# hangman_game
This is a hangman that I created to show my python coding capabilities as well as my knowledge with API's and webscraping. 

The aim of game is simply, guess all the letters. You are initially prompted to choose a category of either Pokemon (API), Capital Cities (webscraping) and Countries (webscraping).
The game will then choose a item from one of the categories, hide all the available characters and then it is you job to guess the hidden letters!
You have 10 lives to guess, once you have filled in the word or run out of lives the game will then ask if you would like to play again. 

This is the first project that I have uploaded to Github, and there are some small bits that need tweaking (mainly the non-alphanumeric characthers in the Country names)

Any comments are greatly appreciated!
